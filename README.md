## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Assignment 1/**: Contains the first assignment, focusing on the implementation of foundational collaborative filtering algorithms.
- **Assignment 2/**: Includes the second assignment, which involves advanced topics and applications in collaborative filtering.
- **CF-Midsem/**: Comprises the mid-semester project, demonstrating the practical application of collaborative filtering methods.

---

## Code Overview

Each directory contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) and supplementary resources:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Model Implementation**: Custom implementations of collaborative filtering algorithms, such as user-based and item-based filtering.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Functions to assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Precision-Recall.
- **Results and Analysis**: Detailed exploration of outcomes, including visualizations and discussions on algorithm effectiveness.

---

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Development**: Implemented both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering techniques.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with various parameters to optimize model performance.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Addressed challenges related to large-scale data and proposed solutions for efficient computation.
